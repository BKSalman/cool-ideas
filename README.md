# Cool ideas
This repo is to gather cool ideas I wanna do\did :)

- [ ] Make ``Musawarah``
- [x] [A featureful personal Twitch chat bot](https://github.com/BKSalman/sadmadbotlad)
- [x] [A GUI for yt-dlp](https://github.com/BKSalman/ytdlp-gui)
- [ ] Implement a protocol (most likely websocket)
- [ ] Make a clone of [this software](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim)
- [ ] A clone of [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/)
- [ ] A alternative for Discord that has proper screen sharing (with audio) support for linux (when I become a 1000x dev)
- [ ] Make bindings to [playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) library in rust
- [ ] An AI model that can explain الإعراب of a word in Arabic
- [ ] A simple app that measures the time it takes to press every key, to see the hardest to reach and can help optimize keymaps
- [x] Attempt [a file transfer CLI](https://github.com/BKSalman/send_files) (could be turned into a super simple GUI later) (got inspired by [magic-wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole))
- [ ] Make a [window manager](https://github.com/BKSalman/bunnuafeth)
